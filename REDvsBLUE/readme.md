# 🔴🟦 Red vs Blue — Box Drawing Game

A nostalgic remake of the **classic box-drawing game** we used to play as kids — now in Python with a digital twist!

As a child, I loved the game where we connected dots to create boxes. This project recreates that experience with a modern UI using **Tkinter**.
